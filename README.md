# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I am Issa. I am a Pomak guy from the northern part of Greece. I did my bachelor in Physics at the Univeristy of Crete, Greece and I am currently a Master's student of Astronomy at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands. My current interests involve exoplanets and accretion disks in active galactic nuclei.

Yeehaw!
